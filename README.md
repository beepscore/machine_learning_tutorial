hierarchical clustering
neural networks


## linear regression
### packages
scikit-learn
quandl
pandas


### supervised machine learning
features and labels
#### features
descriptive attributes, for stock prices it's the "continuous data" (time series?)
#### labels
what you want to predict or forecast

## Appendix - Anaconda
I used Anaconda navigator. Created environment machine_learning.
Installed quandl
https://anaconda.org/anaconda/quandl

matplotlib was in environment root, but not in machine_learning.
Installed matplotlib in machine_learning.
